<p>Financial inclusion&mdash;measured by the <a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/g20fidata/">access, usage and quality</a> of financial services&mdash;is <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-growth-and-opportunity/financial-services-for-the-poor">vital</a> to being able to overcome the cost of extreme poverty. Many people in rural, impoverished regions face scarce financial service providers and cannot afford the time or money that would be required to access these services. As of 2017, there are <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion adults</a> who do not have bank accounts and virtually all of them live in developing countries. Digital financial services are one focus of global poverty reduction efforts and progress has been accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>Inaccessibility of Financial Services</h3>

<p>Though the number of banks per adult in low and middle income countries <a href="https://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C&sId=1460040555909">increased by 19%</a> in the decade preceding 2019, it remains a challenge for many to access financial services. Only <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-growth-and-opportunity/financial-services-for-the-poor">63% of adults in developing countries</a> are account owners. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/brief/achieving-universal-financial-access-by-2020">Factors preventing account ownership</a> include affordability and framework, distance from and lack of trust in financial service providers and lack of documentation.</p>

<p>People without bank accounts have to <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-growth-and-opportunity/financial-services-for-the-poor">rely solely on cash</a> for transactions. This complicates sending or receiving money, as well as saving money securely. Savings in many households take the form of livestock, jewellry or property. Money transfers&mdash;such as those to family&mdash;become much less secure when done in cash (sometimes carried by third-parties). These transfers also cost time, effort and money that many of those in extreme poverty cannot spare.</p>

<h3>Efforts in Digitalization</h3>

<p>Institutions addressing global poverty, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank, have made expanding digital financial services for those in extreme poverty a priority in working toward financial inclusion. The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview">World Bank</a> identifies that the countries that have made the most progress in financial inclusion have been welcoming of new business models and embraced e-commerce and mobile financial services. <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">Digital financial services</a> can help reduce poverty&mdash;especially for women&mdash;by improving methods for saving, which enables business development and fosters ease of transactions that can mitigate financial risk. Another noted outcome of expanding the use of digital payments is improved efficiency of transactions and fewer associated crimes.</p>

<p>Adults around the world have already been <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">increasing their use of digital payments</a>. In developing countries, 44% of adults made or received at least one digital payment during 2017&mdash;an increase of 12% since 2014. High-income economies saw a similar increase of 11%, reaching a total of 91% of adults making or receiving at least a single digital payment. This demonstrates the contrast in banking environments alongside the synchronous growth in account ownership and use. </p>

<h3>Financial Inclusion Amid COVID-19</h3>

<p>Digital financing was helpful to those with limited access to financial services prior to the pandemic; and since, itâ€™s <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/01/digital-financial-inclusion-in-the-times-of-covid-19/">prevalence has grown</a>. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, digital financial services have been found to facilitate financial activity amid lockdowns and sheltering. The pandemic has magnified obstacles to financial inclusion, experienced predominantly by those in poverty, and the world has responded with digitalization. </p>

<p><a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">Two in three adults</a> where greater than 5% of the population are without an account own a mobile phone. This would provide them access to an online banking system. True financial inclusion will require well developed systems, infrastructure and regulations to go hand in hand with digital technology. The new energy surrounding financial digitalization shows promise for widespread adoption and advancement, and subsequent inclusion of those in poverty.</p>
