<p><a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2020/sustainable-energy-for-one-billion-people-by-2030.html">One in 10 people</a> in the world (800 million) do not have access to electricity, and the access of an additional 2.8 billion people is insufficient. In regions with insufficient access to electricity, standard of living is poor&mdash;particularly with regard to adequate healthcare and education. Africa is such a region. Half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lives without electricity. Improving energy in Africa is essential to economic growth and prosperity across the continent&mdash;all three of which are priorities of numerous international organizations.</p>

<h3>A Drained Economy</h3>

<p>Energy is vital to reducing the cost of business activities and creating economic opportunities and jobs. More than <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/the-high-5/light-up-and-power-africa-%E2%80%93-a-new-deal-on-energy-for-africa">640 million Africans</a> lack any access to electricity. The implications of insufficient access to electricity include increased risk of death related to wood-burning stoves, restricted hospitals and emergency services, decreased quality and accessibility of education and greater business costs.</p>

<p>Household health and productivity are deeply burdened by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/boosting-energy-access-in-africa-systemic-approach/">wood-burning stoves</a>. This dated method has drawbacks which include indoor pollution, deforestation, and unpaid time spent to collect biomass fuel. The rate of death due to indoor pollution in Africa is <a href="https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/Brochure_New_Deal_2_red.pdf">one in 2000 people</a>, by a 2017 estimate. African economies suffer because of these and other barriers to participation and stability. Industrialization is key to economic growth in Africa. There is an entire day dedicated to it: Nov. 20, <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/africa-industrialization-day">Africa Industrialization Day</a>. To industrialize the continent, energy in Africa needs to be sustainable and easily accessible as electricity everywhere.</p>

<h3>An Opportunity</h3>

<p>Africa already has <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/the-high-5/light-up-and-power-africa-%E2%80%93-a-new-deal-on-energy-for-africa">significant capacity</a> for improvements in energy. Much of this potential lies in renewable energy sources. For example, one fifth of Africaâ€™s current energy is produced using hydropower. Hydropower, however, is only being utilized to one tenth of its potential. Along with hydropower energy, solar, biomass, wind and geothermal energy all show promise for further development. The shift toward renewable energy is gaining momentum across the globe, largely due to its environmental advantages, and including Africa in this shift is essential to economic growth throughout the continent. </p>

<h3>An Industrialized Continent</h3> 

<p>The African Development Bank (AfDB), the Economic Commission for Africa and the United Nations Development Programme jointly hosted the <a href="https://www.uneca.org/aec2020">2020 African Economic Conference</a> from Dec. 8 to 10. The conference facilitated discussions among leading academics, early-career researchers, policymakers and decision-makers to ensure that efforts toward African industrialization are maximally informed, consider the challenges unique to local economies and stress sustainable and renewable energy.</p>

<p>The AfDB Group&mdash;a key voice at the African Economic Conference&mdash;is leading a strategy to help develop energy in Africa and achieve universal electricity access for Africans by 2025. <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/the-high-5/light-up-and-power-africa-%E2%80%93-a-new-deal-on-energy-for-africa">Their strategy</a> strives to build awareness of barriers to economic development, secure innovative funding for energy developments and strengthen energy policy and regulation. The emphasized ideal for energy in Africa is renewable; nevertheless, efficient and less expensive methods of energy production can quickly work to stimulate the economy. Gas will be an <a href="https://energycouncil.com/articles/help-investors-deliver-bold-projects-for-africa/">important transition fuel</a> as efforts are made to establish cleaner, maintainable methods.</p>

<p>The road to industrialization in Africa is evolving, with new momentum derived from global and continental potential for renewable energy development. International organizations around the world have responded by prioritizing energy developments in Africa. With innovative projects and funding, electricity is planned to be made universal across the continent and foster long-obstructed economic growth.</p>
