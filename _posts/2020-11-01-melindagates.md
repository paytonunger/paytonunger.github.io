<p>Melinda Gates, co-founder and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation&mdash;the Gates’ private foundation centered around enhancing global healthcare, reducing extreme poverty and improving American education&mdash;is a determined global advocate and proponent of equal opportunity. Published in 2019, her first book, “The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World”, leads a discussion of gender equality and the potential for unbounded empowerment, pulling from many personal experiences throughout her life and with the foundation. Equal rights for women is a comprehensive issue but a few key ideas can be identified in Melinda Gates’ advocacy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><h5>“Gender equity lifts everyone.” (The Moment of Lift, p.26)</h5></p> 

<p>Systemic inequalities exist between the genders everywhere. The struggle for those in poverty to lift themselves from it is often greater for women because of legal and societal limits to their autonomy. When governments and communities lift restrictions on women, doors open for everyone&mdash;not only for women.</p>

<p>Financial independence is <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-growth-and-opportunity/gender-equality">essential for having control</a> of one’s education, health, marital and reproductive choices and employment. The inequalities between men and women, particularly in terms of career opportunities, affect economies on all developmental levels. One such inequality is that 90 economies still impose at least one restriction on the jobs available to women. Progress has been made in 40 economies across the world in terms of equal opportunity for women. The average score of these 40 economies on the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32639/9781464815324.pdf">Women, Business, and the Law (WBL) index</a>&mdash;a measure of how laws affect the economic participation of women working and living in their economic center&mdash;increased from 69.8% to 76.4% between 2017 and 2020. These improvements are not solely in the best interest of women; they allow for growth throughout entire economies. There is a positive correlation between the WBL index and income per capita, demonstrating that, as Melinda Gates says, “when you invest in women, you invest in the people who invest in everybody else,” and the entire community will profit.</p></li>
<li><p><h5>“…contraceptives are the greatest life-saving, poverty-ending, women-empowering innovation ever created.” (The Moment of Lift, p.18)</h5></p>

<p>Melinda Gates shared a story from a trip to India with the Gates Foundation, where she met a local mother of two who had only weeks-prior given birth to her second son. In response to Gates asking the mother if she wanted more children, she said she did not; she wasn’t even sure of how she would feed her second child. The mother went on to plead that Gates take her two children home with her. This moment sparked Gates’ passion for family planning and preventing mothers from feeling incapable of caring for their children. She now identifies access to contraceptives as the first priority for women. (The Moment of Lift, p.55)</p>

<p>Contraceptives give couples and individuals the power to choose when or if they want children, and how many. This power not only reduces maternal and newborn mortality rates, it enables the lives saved to be healthy and comfortable. A significant reason for the latter is that families of fewer children tend to be able to better provide for their children and experience <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/resources/contraceptives-save-lives">less economic burden</a>. Family planning is essential to breaking the cycle of poverty&mdash;no country in the <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/resources/contraceptives-save-lives">last 50 years</a> has emerged from poverty without expanding access to contraceptives&mdash;yet, as of 2019, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/adding-it-up-investing-in-sexual-reproductive-health-2019">218 million women</a> of reproductive age in low and middle income countries have an unmet need for modern contraceptives. Current <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/what-we-do/global-development/family-planning">obstacles</a> to advancing family planning include funding, product suitability, distribution and cultural or communicative differences.</p></li>
<li><p><h5>“Connect deeply with others.”</h5></p>

<p>Empathy is a cornerstone of fighting extreme poverty. Melinda Gates writes in her book about the barriers behind poverty. Barriers are built in dispute and Gates explains that “when people can’t agree, it’s often because there is no empathy, no sense of shared experience.” (The Moment of Lift, p.173)The world tends to create outsiders by marginalizing groups that embody fears of humanity and women are particularly vulnerable to this marginalization. (The Moment of Lift, p.49-52) When efforts are made to understand the hurt of others, connections are cultivated that illuminate needs and champion change. According to Gates, diversity is essential for equality. (The Moment of Lift, p.226) Diversity in leaders, representatives and advocates furthers inclusion&mdash;this can be seen domestically and globally&mdash;because it builds or repairs connections to neglected groups.</p>

<p>In her book, Melinda Gates wrote about the importance of sharing stories, rooted in her belief that it has the power to change culture. (The Moment of Lift, p.148) Gates tells of a village she visited in Niger where women gather to talk whenever they have the opportunity, and this sharing of experiences throughout the community allowed for knowledge of contraceptives and family planning to be spread where such information was otherwise difficult to access. (The Moment of Lift, p.60) Listening to others&mdash;regardless of the degree of differences that exist&mdash;when fighting extreme poverty and working to improve women’s rights supplies the knowledge for methods to be adapted to the capabilities of the community and customs to be upheld, fostering respect between providers and recipients of aid.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are limits to the insight that data can provide; the stories that Melinda shares could not be communicated by percentages or indexes. Behind every statistic that paints the picture of extreme poverty and inequality experienced by women are mothers and daughters who did not choose life on the margins. As Melinda Gates’ activism demonstrates, remembering the individuals embodied by global data encourages progress that is most needed and most supported, locally and globally.
