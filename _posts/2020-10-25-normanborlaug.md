<p>Norman Borlaug, winner of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize and founder of the <a href="https://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/about_the_foundation/">World Food Prize</a>&mdash;an international honor for advancements in human development and food availability&mdash;is esteemed in the scope of agriculture and world development and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-109publ395/pdf/PLAW-109publ395.pdf">credited by Congress</a> for having “saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived.” <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1970/borlaug/facts/">Norman Borlaug</a> received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in Mexico, where he improved agricultural methods and developed dwarf wheat&mdash;a strain of wheat better suited for conditions in the region. The nation became self-sufficient in grain as a result of Dr. Borlaug’s efforts. Dr. Borlaug continued to improve pace of cultivation around the world by introducing dwarf wheat to India and Pakistan, and prompted widespread progress that is known today as the Green Revolution. The <a href="https://borlaug.tamu.edu/">Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture at Texas A&M University</a>&mdash;founded in 1984 but renamed in 2006 to honor the late agronomist&mdash;is dedicated to continuing the Norman Borlaug legacy and outlines seven guiding principles that are widely relevant to fighting global poverty.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><h5>Preventing conflict by addressing poverty and hunger.</h5> Dr. Borlaug’s successful cultivation of wheat inspired similar strides to be made by scientists working on <a href="https://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm?nodeID=87449&audienceID=1#impact_asia">rice cultivation in Asia</a>. The effects of improved rice yields not only reduced child mortality rates and malnutrition and increased the time children spent in school, it resulted in less armed conflict in the regions where scientists had introduced sustainable solutions for hunger. This is one example of a key belief held by Dr. Borlaug that agricultural innovation can transform social conditions. War often deepens injustices faced by marginalized groups but Norman Borlaug’s offers hope in freeing people of this burden. </p></li>
<li><p><h5>Employing agriculture science to address poverty and hunger.</h5> Norman Borlaug believed that advancing rural infrastructure, agricultural research and education was and would continue to be essential for a <a href="https://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm?nodeID=87449&audienceID=1#conclusion">second Green Revolution</a>. He spent the remainder of his life contributing to developments in agriculture science and education abroad. Dr. Borlaug’s past efforts, awards and legacy exhibit that lessening hunger is a crucial step in lessening global poverty. </p></li>
<li><p><h5>Taking it to the farmer.</h5> The work that Dr. Borlaug spearheaded in Mexico exemplifies the importance of <a href="https://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm?nodeID=87449&audienceID=1#confronting">appealing to local farmers</a>. Norman Borlaug’s open communication with the farmers he was committed to helping provided him with second-hand experience that informed the wheat modifications, enabling Mexico’s self-sufficiency. Dr. Borlaug showed that effective solutions are born from thorough comprehension of the problems being faced and he spent his life developing such comprehension at the source.</p></li>
<li><p><h5>Engaging in an interdisciplinary approach.</h5> Dr. Borlaug was an advocate for <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Sunday-Q-A-No-easy-solutions-to-food-price-rise-1788455.php">genetically modified organisms</a> being used to increase food production as cultivable land dwindles. His forward-thinking is just one indication that incorporating new approaches from various fields of study into poverty reduction strategies can be valuable for continued progress amid changing conditions. Borlaug was also a proponent of education and valued opportunities to bring others from various walks of life into the fight against global poverty.</p></li>
<li><p><h5>Encouraging effective governance and sound policies.</h5> Every year, the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology&mdash;a nonprofit founded in 1972 with a mission to provide science-based information to policymakers&mdash;presents the <a href="https://www.cast-science.org/awards/borlaug-cast-communication-award/">Borlaug CAST Communication Award</a> in honor of the late agronomist. The award recognizes a professional in agricultural, environmental or food science who has contributed to scientific advancements in public policy. Awards for advocacy can serve as effective incentives for continued efforts to inform leaders and employ foreign policy to reduce poverty. </p></li>
<li><p><h5><a href="https://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm?nodeID=87449&audienceID=1#youth_education">Promoting youth development.</a></h5> Norman Borlaug recognized the importance of public interest in global food security and much of his life’s work included promoting it in younger generations. His educational efforts included a position as Distinguished Professor at Texas A&M University, attending and lecturing at conferences as well as the establishment of the World Food Prize Youth Institute, where high school age students are able to learn from experts and discuss the future of world hunger. When people listen to those experiencing poverty and hunger and advocate on their behalf great changes can be made, as Dr. Borlaug has shown.</p></li>
<li><p><h5>Acting more, talking less.</h5> Known as the father of the Green Revolution, Dr. Borlaug’s voice was and remains well respected by the agricultural science community. As much as he used his platform for advocacy, a significant amount of Norman Borlaug’s influence came from the time he spent on the margins where he worked to lift people from extreme hunger.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Norman Borlaug will forever be remembered for his part in transforming agriculture for many impoverished countries. His commitment to educating and mobilizing others left a coalition dedicated to continuing Borlaug’s work of bringing sustainable agricultural developments to those suffering from extreme poverty. The principles above guided Dr. Borlaug on his humanitarian mission and continue to be relevant as others carry on in the global fight against poverty and hunger.</p>
